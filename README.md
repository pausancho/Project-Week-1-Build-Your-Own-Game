## Organization

I organized my work with trello.

I created a board with all the tasks and used a notebook and a pen to sketch some ideas on how the sowftare should work.   

My repository contains a README.md file, a .gitignore and a folder called your-project with a main.ipynb file containing the code, a main.py file and a password_generator_software.ipynb.
